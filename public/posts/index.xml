      <description>CPU Scheduling CPU Scheduling is a process of determining which process will own CPU for execution while another process is on hold. When one process has to wait the os takes the cpu from that process and give it to another process CPU scheduling alogrithms CPU and I/O Burst Cycles process execution consists of a cycle of cpu execution and I/O wait. process alternates between these 2 states process execution begins with : CPU burst I/O burst CPU burst I/O burst &amp;hellip; CPU burst is when the process is being executed in the CPU I/O burst is when the cpu is waiting for I/O for further execution preemptive scheduling : a high priority process can be given the CPU when a process switches from running state to ready state (interruption) when a process switches from waiting state to ready state (completion of I/O) non preemptive scheduling : a process will not be distrubed until it is complete when a process switches from running to waiting state (waiting for I/O) when a process terminates Scheduling criteria ðŸ“‹ CPU utilization : we want to keep the cpu as busy as possible.</description>
