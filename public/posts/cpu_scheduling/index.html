<li><em>CPU burst</em></li>
<li><em>I/O burst</em></li>
<li><em>CPU burst</em></li>

<ol>
<li>preemptive scheduling : a high priority process can be given the CPU
<ul>
<li>when a process switches from <em>running state</em> to <em>ready state</em> (interruption)</li>
<li>when a process switches from <em>waiting state</em> to <em>ready state</em> (completion of I/O)</li>

</li>
<li>non preemptive scheduling : a process will not be distrubed until it is complete

<li>Although the SJF algorithm is optimal, it cannot be implemented at the level of short-term CPU scheduling.</li>
<li>The real difficulty with the SJF algorithm is knowing the length of the next CPU request.</li>
<li>There is no way to know the length of the next CPU burst.
One approach is:</li>
<li>To try to approximate SJF scheduling.</li>
<li>We may not know the length of the next CPU burst, but we may be able to predict its value.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="ps-priority-scheduling-">PS (Priority Scheduling) 📋</h3>
<ul>
<li>A priority is associated with each process, and the CPU is allocated to the process with the highest priority.</li>
<li>Equal-priority processes are scheduled in FCFS order.</li>
<li>An SJF algorithm is simply a priority algorithm where the priority is the inverse of the (predicted) next CPU burst.</li>
<li>The larger the CPU burst, the lower the priority, and vice versa.</li>
<li>Priority scheduling can be either <strong>preemptive</strong> or <strong>nonpreemptive</strong></li>
<li>A preemptive priority scheduling algorithm will preempt the CPU if the priority of the newly arrived process is higher than the priority of the currently running process.</li>
<li>A nonpreemptive priority scheduling algorithm will simply put the new process at the head of the ready queue.</li>

<ul>
<li>in heavily loaded computer system with a stady steam of high priority processes can prevent a low priority process of ever getting to use the cpu</li>

<h3 id="rr-round-robin-scheduling-">RR (Round Robin Scheduling) ⏲️</h3>
<ul>
<li>Round Robin algorithm is specifically designed for time sharing systems</li>
<li>It is similar to FCFS scheduling but premption is added to switch between processes</li>
<li>A small unit of time called time quantum or time slice is defined (<em>generally from 10 to 100 ms</em>)</li>
<li>we keep the ready queue as FIFO queue</li>
<li>different scenarios
<ul>
<li>CPU burst &lt; 1 time quantum :
<ul>
<li>the process will release the cpu voluntarily</li>
<li>the cpu scheduler will go to the next ready process in the ready queue</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>CPU burst &gt; 1 time quantum :
<ul>
<li>interruption of the os</li>
<li>a context switch will be executed and the process will be put at the end of the tail</li>
<li>cpu scheduler will select the next process in the ready queue</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
